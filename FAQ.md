## Who is this for?

A few types of people might find the Grove useful:

- People who want to learn to program, but are put off by the amount of background
  knowledge (e.g. Unix, compilers, frameworks) necessary to create anything
  really useful.
- Power users who spend a lot of time writing (code or otherwise) on different
  operating systems, and who don't want to have to switch their mental keymap
  every time they switch platforms.
- People who want explicit, fine-grained control over the entirety of a system,
  but who find customizing Linux too complex for their purposes.
- People with repetitive motion injuries from using a mouse or trackpad (the
  Grove is keyboard-only).
- Programmers who enjoy working on JavaScript hobby projects but find themselves
  spending more time crafting build systems and wrangling frameworks than actually
  writing production code.

Then there are the people who might find the Grove more beautiful than useful.
They might treat it as an art project or a thought experiment.

- People who envision a world where software companies don't mediate our
  every interaction, and where computers are no longer
  [optimized for addictiveness](http://www.timewellspent.io/).
- Functional programming dabblers (the truly obsessed aren't going to like
  JavaScript's dynamic typing) who are curious about what an ecosystem of
  purely functional programs might look like.
- People who want to feel like they are t3h l33t haxx0rz.
- People who like the idea of [TempleOS](http://templeos.org/) but who don't
  want to be associated with its creator's racist conspiracy theories or
  unusual theology.

There's overlap between these groups, of course. I'm in all of them.

## Won't storing all my data in one HTML file cause my computer to run out of memory?

No. The key here is that the Grove is a truly *personal* computer. It doesn't have
massive amounts of bloatware that it's constantly updating. It doesn't have
hundreds of arcane system files that will break your computer if you delete
them. It doesn't have applications like Word that store data in convoluted,
inefficient formats. The only data it stores is the data that you create yourself.

When computers run out of memory or storage space, it's almost always
because some program is spewing garbage that no one will ever read.
A single human simply can't produce (by hand, at least) enough information
to cause memory or storage problems on a modern computer.

A few reference points:
[Tolstoy's _War and Peace_](https://konklone.com/assets/images/blog/sha-1/war-and-peace.txt)
is 3.2 megabytes of text.
[The complete works of Shakespeare](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.006/s08/lecturenotes/files/t8.shakespeare.txt)
take up 5.2 megabytes.
Simply loading the YouTube home page downloads about 2.5
megabytes of data, incurring a much higher performance penalty (due to the
relative slowness of the network) than loading the same amount of data from
disk. So even if you're as prolific as Shakespeare, your computer
will be under no more strain than if you were browsing the web.

A lifetime of writing can add up to a lot of data, of course.
[Mark Twain wrote between 1000 and 3000 words per day](http://aaronjfisher.github.io/mark-twain-was-a-stats-fan.html),
suggesting that if he spent 55 years of his life writing
and didn't take any days off, his lifetime output might have been
close to 300 megabytes.

Even if you write as much as Mark Twain, it's going to take you decades
to produce hundreds of megabytes of text. In that time, computers will get
exponentially more powerful, and storage exponentially cheaper, while the total
size of your _oeuvre_ will increase only linearly.

It'll probably be fine.

## What's with the 1980s old-computer vibe?

Even though the Grove isn't a *website*, it's displayed in a web browser.
If it looked more like a website, people might try to interact with it like it's
a website, which wouldn't work. The 1980s-PC look and feel
reinforce the idea that the Grove is a new kind of thing.
The conventions you've learned for interacting with things in a web browser
don't apply to it.
